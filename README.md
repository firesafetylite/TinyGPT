[![License: GPL-2.0-only](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPL--2.0--only-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

**TinyGPT is a small, freestanding ARM64 operating system that boots directly through UEFI.** It provides a persistent direct FAT-backed filesystem, an isolated pre-OS recovery environment, an interactive text editor, firmware-backed updates, and a native Freedoom port. It is built from scratch in C and does not use a Unix or Linux kernel.

> TinyGPT is the project name; the operating system is not a language model. The disk image does use a standard GUID Partition Table (GPT).

## Native firmware migration (unreleased)

`make native` now builds a TinyGPT-owned BIOS, a separately loaded `TINYGPT.ELF`
OS, and a factory disk, with **no EDK II dependency**. The native target has
firmware-resident recovery, writable FAT, graphical/serial consoles, VirtIO
keyboard input, accounts, and Settings. Its disposable-disk lifecycle and
custom-colored scrollback are tested with `make native-test`.

See [native firmware setup, validation, and migration limits](firmware/native/README.md).
Existing VMs need a clean shutdown, a fresh full backup, matching BIOS/ELF images,
and supported hardware configuration—not just a firmware-file swap. Native
HTTP/TLS updates are not implemented. Nightly now also publishes
`TinyGPT-nightly-native.zip`, containing the matched BIOS/ELF, checksums,
installation notes, and a factory disk for **new VMs only**. The existing `.img`
and EFI updater downloads below remain the UEFI distribution, not native upgrades.

## Highlights

- Boots as a native AArch64 UEFI application
- Ships as one 128 MiB GPT/FAT disk image
- Stores each shell file and directory as an authoritative FAT entry under `TINYGPTFS/ROOT`
- Verifies the filesystem and operating system before every normal boot
- Keeps recovery tools and the global account database on a protected partition that survives an OS wipe
- Requires password login on every normal boot and administrator re-authentication for privileged writes
- Supports multiple bootable system/data partitions
- Includes protected `/system`, `/apps`, and `/lost+found` trees
- Provides a full-screen text editor, persistent settings, and 256-line scrollback
- Updates through UEFI HTTP/TLS or the host-side `tinygpt` command
- Runs Freedoom natively through UEFI graphics and keyboard protocols

## Download and boot

Download `TinyGPT-vVERSION.img` from the [latest release](https://github.com/firesafetylite/TinyGPT/releases/latest), then verify it with the release's `SHA256SUMS` file. The `.img` file is the only maintained boot distribution; old `.utm` bundles are supported only as explicit migration targets by the host updater.

### UTM on Apple silicon

1. Create an **Emulate** virtual machine.
2. Choose **Other** as the operating system and **ARM64** as the architecture.
3. Enable UEFI boot and allocate at least 256 MiB of RAM.
4. Import `TinyGPT-vVERSION.img` as a non-removable VirtIO drive.
5. For networking, use **Shared Network** with a `virtio-net-pci` adapter.
6. Start the VM. UEFI should load `EFI/BOOT/BOOTAA64.EFI` automatically.

If the firmware opens its own shell instead, run:

```text
fs0:\EFI\BOOT\BOOTAA64.EFI
```

## Disk layout

The maintained image has two initial partitions and unallocated expansion space:

| GPT partition | Label | Format | Purpose |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `TINYRECOV` | FAT16 ESP | Protected bootloader and pre-OS recovery environment |
| 2 | `TINYGPT` | FAT32 | Direct TinyGPT filesystem, settings, and Freedoom data |
| 3+ | User supplied | FAT16 | Additional system/data partitions created from recovery |

Important files include:

```text
Partition 1: TINYRECOV
├── EFI/BOOT/BOOTAA64.EFI
└── TINYAUTH0.DAT / TINYAUTH1.DAT  redundant global account generations

Partition 2: TINYGPT
├── TINYGPT.NEW              first-boot installation marker (removed after install)
├── DOOMU.WAD                Freedoom Phase 1
├── TINYFS.RET               durable legacy-import retirement marker
└── TINYGPTFS/
    ├── FORMAT.DAT           completed direct-format marker
    ├── TXN.CMT/TXN.BAK      redundant mutation manifests when recovery is pending
    └── ROOT/                authoritative shell files and directories
```

Partition 1 is never exposed through normal filesystem commands. Partition 2 retains its original extent, while the remaining image space is available to `partition add`.

## Boot verification and recovery

Before launching the shell, TinyGPT verifies:

1. ARM64 UEFI firmware and the platform timer
2. The TinyGPT boot volume
3. The direct-format marker and any interrupted transaction
4. FAT-tree readability, required protected entries, bounds, and observational scan-time hashes
5. The installed operating-system state

Press **Enter** during the startup window to open the partition selector. The default delay is two seconds; **Settings > 9 — Auto boot timer** changes it to 1–60 seconds for the next boot. **Esc** or **R** opens firmware recovery during the same window. Use Up/Down to choose a target, Enter to boot, **S** to save the default, or **R** to enter recovery. Recovery also opens automatically when the selected system is missing, cannot be mounted, or fails structural/readability checks. It never silently repairs a damaged installation.

The pre-OS environment supports:

```text
partitions                     list registered GPT partitions
partition add MIB NAME         create a named FAT partition (minimum 4 MiB)
partition delete N             delete managed partition metadata after administrator authentication
partition name N NAME          rename a non-protected partition
use N                          select a partition for file navigation
order N                        save a partition as the default
scan N                         verify direct FAT entries and transaction state
repair N                       recover or install TinyGPT after administrator authentication
pwd / ls / cd                  navigate the selected partition
cat / stat / tree              inspect files and metadata
reset N                        reset and reinstall after administrator authentication
scroll / scroll clear          inspect or clear recovery scrollback
boot [N]                       verify and start a partition
reboot / shutdown              restart or power off
```

Names may contain 1–11 letters, digits, underscores, or hyphens. They are normalized to uppercase and must be unique. Allocation uses aligned first-fit space, so a deleted partition's extent can be reused without overlapping existing entries or GPT-reserved sectors. A newly created partition is activated after one required firmware reboot, then TinyGPT initializes it automatically.

`partition delete N` accepts only a registered TinyGPT-managed FAT entry whose GPT and FAT labels match the registry. Partition 1 and its recovery volume can never be deleted. The command displays the label and extent and requires an administrator username and password. Deletion clears only the 128-byte GPT entry, freeing the extent; it does **not** overwrite partition contents and is not secure erasure. After any GPT change, reboot before another partition change, selection, or boot because firmware filesystem enumeration is stale. A registry-cleanup failure is reported as a committed deletion and the slot must not be reused before recovery.

The regular shell's `partitions` command is read-only. Partition creation, deletion, naming, repair, reset, boot-order changes, and recovery-partition access remain pre-OS-only.

### One-time legacy import

When no valid `TINYGPTFS/FORMAT.DAT` exists, TinyGPT may import the newest fully valid legacy `TINYFS0.BIN` or `TINYFS1.BIN`. It rejects malformed nodes, cycles, invalid names, checksum errors, and case-insensitive sibling collisions. Import materializes and verifies individual entries first, commits the direct-format marker, and only then attempts to remove both legacy files. Firmware deletion failures may leave stale import files, but a durable `TINYFS.RET` retirement marker outside the direct namespace prevents them from becoming authority again even if `FORMAT.DAT` is later damaged. If allocation, write, flush, rename, or verification fails before marker and retirement commit, legacy files remain available for a later retry or explicit recovery. Once direct activation completes, direct FAT storage wins and legacy files are not treated as live authority.

## Direct FAT filesystem and the shell

The shell maps `/` to `TINYGPTFS/ROOT` on the selected system partition. Each logical file or directory is an individual authoritative FAT entry accessed with UEFI `EFI_FILE_PROTOCOL`; the 96-entry in-memory table contains metadata only, and file bytes are read on demand into bounded command/editor buffers. Paths support absolute and relative forms, `~`, `cd -`, nested directories, and files up to 8191 bytes. FAT names are matched case-insensitively, and invalid, colliding, oversized, or over-capacity trees fail scanning instead of being ignored. File hashes shown by `stat` are observational values refreshed from current FAT content during scanning, not persisted trust anchors capable of detecting historical content drift.

File replacement writes, verifies, and flushes `TINYGPTFS/TXN.NEW`, records `TINYGPTFS/TXN.CMT`, preserves the prior entry as `TINYGPTFS/TXN.PREV`, and then promotes the new file. Failed writes are reported and do not claim persistence. Boot recovery uses redundant manifests to resolve an interrupted journal before mounting; torn manifests with no moved payload are discarded, while irrecoverably corrupt manifests with a recovery payload are preserved and require explicit `reset` rather than risking silent data loss. Recursive deletion is journaled and resumed rather than backed by a complete second tree. `repair` recovers transactions and restores protected defaults without overwriting user files, while `reset` explicitly reinstalls defaults.

### Filesystem commands

```text
pwd
ls [PATH]
tree [PATH]
cd [PATH|-]
cat PATH
write PATH [TEXT]
append PATH TEXT
mkdir PATH
rm PATH
rm -rf PATH
rmdir PATH
cp SOURCE DEST
mv SOURCE DEST
stat PATH
df
fsck
textedit [PATH]
```

Example:

```text
mkdir /home/projects
write /home/projects/hello.txt hello-arm64
cat /home/projects/hello.txt
cp /home/projects/hello.txt /tmp
```

### Accounts and protected system trees

On the first successful boot, TinyGPT asks for a username and a password twice. This first account is always an Administrator. Every later normal boot requires login; unknown usernames never create accounts. Password input is masked. Usernames contain 1–23 letters, digits, underscores, or hyphens and are case-insensitive; passwords contain 8–64 printable ASCII characters and are case-sensitive. Overlong input is rejected, not truncated. Up to eight accounts are supported.

Open `settings`, then choose **8 — User accounts**. This page lists accounts and roles and lets you change your password. Administrators also see options to add an account (Standard or Administrator), change another user's password, and delete an account. Account changes still require password verification. Choose **0** to return to Settings; the shell's `logout` command returns to login.

Administrators can add and delete accounts and change another user's password. Standard users can change their own password. Ordinary non-protected files are shared because this filesystem has no ownership metadata. TinyGPT prevents deletion of the active account and the last administrator. Accounts are global across system partitions and are stored in redundant checksum-validated generations on `TINYRECOV`; passwords use per-account salts and 4096-round SHA-256 derivation and are never stored directly. UEFI RNG supplies salts when available; a bounded timer/generation/counter SHA-256 fallback prevents duplicate salts when firmware has no RNG.

The slot checksums and generations detect torn writes and select the newest locally available copy; falling back to an older copy can also restore older credentials. Only explicit file-not-found results permit fresh setup. Read failures do not imply missing accounts, and a failed account write/flush blocks further authentication until reboot rather than claiming persistence.

This is shell-level access control, not disk encryption or verified boot. Checksums are unkeyed: offline disk access can alter or replay accounts, or erase both slots to restart setup. The 4096-round derivation is not a modern memory-hard password KDF, and fallback salts are not cryptographically random. Protect recovery-volume access and use a unique password, not credentials reused elsewhere.

The `/system`, `/apps`, and `/lost+found` trees remain readable to every account. Writes require an Administrator and password re-authentication for each privileged operation. Partition changes, repair/reset, updates, and exact `rm -rf /` use the same re-authentication rule. Pre-OS asks for an administrator username and password because it has no logged-in session; only an absent or valid zero-account database may start first-administrator setup, while corrupt authentication data fails closed.

After administrator re-authentication, exact `rm -rf /` erases the system partition but does not power off the machine. A partial firmware deletion keeps the volume open so the command can be retried; a complete wipe disables further persistence for that running shell. The isolated pre-OS environment opens on the next boot.

### Text Editor

Open a file directly or launch the interactive picker:

```text
textedit /home/notes/todo.txt
textedit
```

The editor soft-wraps without inserting extra newlines. Arrow keys move through characters and wrapped display rows, Backspace/Delete removes text, and Enter inserts a line break. Press **F2** or **Ctrl+S** to save; press Esc twice to discard unsaved changes. Protected files open read-only for standard users; an Administrator must re-authenticate when saving.

### Settings

Run `settings` for the full-screen configuration interface. It controls:

- Default text and accent colors
- OS console background color with live preview
- Whether the current path appears in the prompt
- Whether the shell starts in `/` or `/home`
- Whether 256-line scrollback is enabled
- **9 — Auto boot timer**: 1–60 seconds (default 2), saved globally after administrator re-authentication and used before system-partition mounting on the next boot
- **10 — Screen resolution**: supported pixel modes, with a live preview; press **Y** to keep, or **N/Esc** to undo. Unconfirmed changes revert after 15 seconds. **D** restores the boot default; **0** cancels
- **User accounts**: account list, password changes, and administrator-only account creation/deletion

Appearance, shell, and confirmed resolution preferences save automatically to `/home/.tinygptrc` on the selected system partition. Resolutions are stored by width/height, not firmware mode numbers. Unsupported saved modes fall back to the boot display without blocking login. Native RAMFB offers 640×480, 800×600, 1024×768, and 1280×720; UEFI lists advertised modes between 640×480 and 1920×1080. Text-only devices report resolution changes as unavailable. Console geometry follows the selected mode; changing resolution clears old, differently wrapped scrollback.

The global boot timer saves separately in checksum-validated `TINYBOOT.DAT` on recovery storage, so it works before the OS mounts and survives a system-partition wipe. Missing or invalid timer data uses two seconds. This is TinyGPT's partition-selection delay, not a separate UEFI firmware splash/menu timeout. **Settings > User accounts** also saves separately to the protected recovery-volume account database, never to `.tinygptrc`. Restoring appearance and shell defaults does not reset the resolution, boot timer, accounts, or passwords.

### Scrollback

```text
Up/Down     scroll one line
PageUp      move one page toward older output
PageDown    move one page toward newer output
Home        jump to the oldest page
End or Esc  return to the live prompt
scroll      show status and controls
scroll clear erase retained scrollback
```

Typing while viewing older output returns to the live prompt.

### Other shell commands

```text
help
clear
scroll [clear]
echo [TEXT]
info
uptime
partitions
textedit [PATH]
settings
logout
update [check] [main|nightly]
doom
reboot
shutdown
```

## Freedoom

Run `doom` to launch Freedoom 0.13.0 Phase 1 through the integrated [PureDOOM](https://github.com/Daivuk/PureDOOM) engine.

```text
WASD        move and strafe
Arrow keys  turn and move
F           fire
E           use/open
Enter       select
Esc         menu
Q or F12    return to TinyGPT
```

Graphics and input use UEFI protocols directly; no Linux layer is involved. Sound and music are disabled, and Doom can be launched once per boot.

## Release channels and updates

| Channel | Branch | Purpose | Published artifact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Stable | [`main`](https://github.com/firesafetylite/TinyGPT/tree/main) | Versioned releases | `TinyGPT-vVERSION.img` |
| Nightly beta (UEFI) | [`nightly`](https://github.com/firesafetylite/TinyGPT/tree/nightly) | Rolling UEFI build | `TinyGPT-nightly.img` |
| Nightly native | [`nightly`](https://github.com/firesafetylite/TinyGPT/tree/nightly) | Matched native BIOS + OS | `TinyGPT-nightly-native.zip` |

Each nightly push replaces the existing [`nightly` prerelease](https://github.com/firesafetylite/TinyGPT/releases/tag/nightly). Stable releases are tagged from `main`. Update commands default to `main`; opting into nightly must be explicit.

### Native BIOS downloads

Download `TinyGPT-nightly-native.zip` and verify it against the release's
`SHA256SUMS`. Inside are a matching 64 MiB BIOS, `TINYGPT.ELF`, a **new-VM-only**
factory disk, installation notes, licenses, per-file checksums, and a manifest
identifying the source commit and ABI. Nightly validates the BIOS/ELF pair and
boots disposable native VMs before publishing it. Never overwrite an existing
user disk with the factory disk or mix BIOS/OS builds; see the
[native installation notes](firmware/native/DISTRIBUTION.md).

Native guest `update` is still unavailable: use a stopped, fully backed-up VM
and prepare the native disk update on the host. The following two updater paths
are **UEFI-only**.

### In-OS updater (UEFI only)

```text
update check
update main
update check nightly
update nightly
```

The updater validates channel compatibility, the manifest, SHA-256 digest, file size, and ARM64 EFI structure before replacing the bootloader. It retains `EFI/BOOT/BOOTAA64.BAK` and requires a reboot to start the installed version.

Guest updates require firmware that exposes UEFI HTTP/TLS. For UTM, keep `TinyGPT-QEMU_EFI.fd` attached as read-only PFlash and `TinyGPT-QEMU_EFI-vars.fd` as writable PFlash variables, with Emulated networking and VirtIO RNG enabled. These firmware files are separate from `TinyGPT.img`; replacing the disk does not replace them.

### Host-side fallback (UEFI only)

If guest firmware does not provide HTTP/TLS, shut down the VM, detach the image from all running VMs, download `tinygpt` from the release, and run:

```bash
chmod +x tinygpt
./tinygpt update --channel main /path/to/TinyGPT.img
./tinygpt update --channel nightly /path/to/TinyGPT.img
```

The host command uses Python's HTTPS stack and changes only `EFI/BOOT/BOOTAA64.EFI` on the recovery partition. Direct filesystem entries, settings, user files, other partitions, and Freedoom remain intact. A backup is created before replacement.

## Standalone firmware development

An **EDK-II-free firmware prototype** is being developed in [`firmware/bios`](firmware/bios/README.md). `make bios` builds its own ARM64 reset code and firmware-resident serial recovery menu; `make bios-test` boots it in isolated QEMU with synthetic read-only disks. It can inspect GPT/FAT and boot a small native ELF payload, but **cannot yet boot the current TinyGPT EFI system or replace the full pre-OS environment**. The working VM and EDK II build remain unchanged until storage, graphics/input, accounts, and the OS have been ported. Do not install this prototype over the working VM firmware.

## Build and test

Requirements:

- Bash and Make
- Python 3.9 or newer
- Zig 0.14.1

Use a pinned Zig installation without modifying the repository:

```bash
python3 -m venv /tmp/tinygpt-venv
/tmp/tinygpt-venv/bin/pip install ziglang==0.14.1
PATH="/tmp/tinygpt-venv/bin:$PATH" make test
PATH="/tmp/tinygpt-venv/bin:$PATH" make
```

A successful build produces:

```text
build/BOOTAA64.EFI
build/TinyGPT.img
```

`build.sh` compiles the freestanding C source, creates the recovery and system partitions, embeds Freedoom, and writes the canonical 128 MiB image. The image builder and host updater use only Python's standard library.

CI checks the Python tools and source invariants, executes the production authentication code against a fake UEFI console/filesystem, and tests the production FAT path builders. Native tests require a host C compiler (`cc`) and explicitly skip when unavailable. CI also verifies that the EFI output is an AArch64 PE32+ application, validates the GPT/FAT layout, and confirms the embedded EFI and Freedoom data. These tests do not replace ARM64 UEFI VM testing of login, recovery, or real firmware flush/power-loss behavior.

The optional `tools/build_uefi_firmware.sh` script builds the custom HTTP/TLS-capable developer firmware. Run `make clean` to remove generated output; everything under `build/` is ignored by Git.
